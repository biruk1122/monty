Stacks and queues are both abstract data structures used for organizing and managing collections of data. They have distinct characteristics and serve different purposes:

Stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out):

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top."
Elements are added to the top of the stack, and the last element added is the first one to be removed.
Stacks are used for managing function calls and maintaining a history of recent actions. They follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Common operations include "push" (add an element to the top) and "pop" (remove an element from the top).
Think of it like a stack of plates, where you add or remove plates from the top.

Queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):

A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
Elements in a queue are processed in the order they were added, following the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Queues are used for tasks like scheduling, managing resources, and handling requests.
Common operations include "enqueue" (add an element to the rear) and "dequeue" (remove an element from the front).
Think of it like a line of people waiting for a service; the person who arrives first gets served first.
